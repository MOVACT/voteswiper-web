Right now the source code is only published to make the project
more transparent and trustworthy. Our long term goal however is
to make the source code available under an open source license
but we are not quite there yet with code preparations and some
legal questions.

We do however have no issues if you fork, modify and play around
with the code as long as you don't publish it anywhere.
